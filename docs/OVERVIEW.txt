# Overview

This site is based on the Django framework. The main functionality is in an app
called 'core' and other apps provide support to that. All the custom code can be
found in 'pylib/mzalendo'.

Other code and projects are currently made available by having them be git
submodules or copies of code in 'external/'. The appropriate bits of these are
then symlinked into 'pylib/'. Please do not modify the code in these, instead
modify the upstream repositories and update the submodule.

Configuration is done by editing the values in 'pylib/mzalendo/settings.py'.
Values which change between installations (eg dev and production) are set in the
file 'conf/general.yml' (use the 'conf/general.yml-example' to get started).
There is also a sample Apache2 config in 'conf/httpd.conf-example' which might
be helpful.

When installing the system note that many additional files and directories will
be created alongside the top level git repo checkout. These include the
'media_root' for uploaded images, and the 'mzalendo_xapian' for the search
index.

All data is stored in the database, but some is copied into the search engine
implemented using Haystack for full text searching.

Location searches are carried out using Google's geolocate tools, with calls
being made to their API. These are cached after the first request.

Boundary data is taken from a MaPit service (a separate install), this is used
to find the constituency for a point and also to serve the KML boundaries used
on the Google maps.
