# TROUBLESHOOTING

If something goes wrong please check the following for help. 
If your problem is not listed please add it after fixing.

## Remember to set up the environment!

If you see errors like this...

    File "./manage.py", line 5, in <module>
    import settings
    ImportError: No module named yaml

...then you probably forgot to set the virtualenv for your current session.
See the VIRTUALENV section in INSTALL.txt.


## Web requests block

If location searches black then check that the external requests to Google are
not hanging.


## Location searches return old/bad data

Try deleting the cached search in 'httplib2_cache'


## ./manage.py migrate will not run correctly

Check that the database has PostGIS added to it


## Caching does not appear to be working

Point your browser at '/status/memcached/' - first hit should save a val to
cache and subsequent ones should show that it is in the cache until the ttl
expires.

Check that you are not logged in, and don't have a sessionid or csrf_token
cookie - both of which will cause caches to fetch you new content.
