# TROUBLESHOOTING

If something goes wrong please check the following for help. 
If your problem is not listed please add it after fixing.

## Remember to set up the environment!

If you see errors like this...

    File "./manage.py", line 5, in <module>
    import settings
    ImportError: No module named yaml

...then you probably forgot to set the virtualenv for your current session.
See the VIRTUALENV section in INSTALL.txt.


## Web requests block

If location searches black then check that the external requests to Google or
MaPit are not hanging.


## Location searches return old/bad data

Try deleting the cached search in 'httplib2_cache'


## ./manage.py migrate will not run correctly

Check that the database has PostGIS added to it
