we failed to devolve the way we planned in the Constitution. The
TA and the appropriate law have never been applied. One day the
governors, the Council of Governors and the President decided to
devolve healthcare in a day. It is not possible. The problem we
are seeing in healthcare is also in other places, only that in
health area players are noisy.”

Quantum (ex-mine value) royalties are levied on a production basis (i.e. a flat rate royalty percentage is charged per unit of mineral recovered) and these rates may change through an amendment to the regulations while Ad valorem (value-based) royalties are levied at a percentage based on the value of the mineral for example 7.5% at crushed and screened, 5% at concentrate and 2.5% metal. Specific rates should apply to low value minerals. In addition to royalties, the government should also receive licence fees depending on the type of licence and the extent of the lease area.</li><li>​T​he Government should establish a fund for royalties for catchment areas to allocate money for important projects in the areas and localities where the natural resources occur. This fund should be administered by an independent body. As a general principle royalty revenues should be allocated to projects that will continue to generate long term benefits for the community; especially capital projects rather than operating or recurrent expenditures.
