<h2>Your Role In Democracy</h2>

<p>Kenyan citizens are expected to find out how politicians are performing to ensure high standards of leadership and integrity are respected and maintained.</p>

<p>As a Kenyan citizen, you have the opportunity to hold your representatives to account in the national elections scheduled to take place in August 2017.</p>

<p>You can use websites like Mzalendo to find out how well your elected representative is doing, to check if they have attended the national assembly and to get news and information too, such as what is said in Parliament. You can follow Mzalendo on Facebook and Twitter. You can hear about the elections next year and who is standing for office.</p>
