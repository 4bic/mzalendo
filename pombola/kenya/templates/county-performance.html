    <h1>How are our taxpayer shillings really being spent?</h1>

    <p>A recent report by Kenya&rsquo;s Controller of Budget highlights questionable spending practices in our counties. Over 50% of our counties spent NO money on development!</p>

    <div id="report">

      <div id="report-header">

        <p>The report reveals that our taxpayer money that this
        is supposed to be spent on building roads and water
        systems as well as equipping and staffing health centres
        and schools, has instead been spent on &ldquo;construction of
        mansions, entertainment allowances and buying of
        luxurious vehicles for Governors and their executives&rdquo;
