These are notes about changes that need to happen for deployments that can not
be automated using migrations etc.


# Nigeria

In requirements.txt the mapit repo used is now on the branch '7-area-unions'. It
should probably be 'master' instead, or 'pypi' as it was. The union branch was
used to accommodate the nigerian boundaries - where some of them are formed of
unions of lesser ones ('Senatorial Districts' are composed of 'Federal
Constituencies' if memory serves).

Before merging the latest changes to the nigeria branch, or switching the
shineyoureye site to master, this needs to be resolved.
