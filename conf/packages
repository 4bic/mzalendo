# Sorry about that, this seemed like a good way to ensure that the changes that 
# got merged in to master don't get deployed by mistake without the follwing 
# things being addressed.

# 1) in requirements.txt the mapit repo used is now on the branch
# '7-area-unions'. It should probably be 'master' instead, or 'pypi' as it was.
# The union branch was used to accomodate the nigerian boundaries - where some
# of them are formed of unions of lesser ones ('Senatorial Districts' are
# composed of 'Federal Constituencies' if memory serves).

# 2) the disqus comments are now on a different page than they used to be. If
# DISQUS_USE_IDENTIFIERS was true in your settings this is no problem (ie
# Nigeria) otherwise it will break all your comments (ie Kenya). The fix is to
# download a list of all the urls and then create the renaming CSV that disqus
# can use to update their records, mapping the urls to 'objectType-123' style
# identifiers and fixing all the comment issues in one go. See
# https://github.com/mysociety/mzalendo/issues/421 for the details.

# 3) the DISQUS_USE_IDENTIFIERS will need to be added to Kenya's config, and set
# to true. I think we should do munge the data in the CSV from (2), change the
# config, deploy and then submit the CSV to disqus. Then a day later check the
# urls they have for any that slipped through the net. That way the comments
# will be broken just until they have a chance to process the CSV. Obviously
# taking a backup first is a good idea too.

# Debian packages that we need.

libapache2-mod-wsgi

# On non-debian systems you'll need to build these using the appropriate tools
# (eg on Mac consider using Homebrew: http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/).


# Database - we use postgres with the postgis addons
postgresql
postgis
libpq-dev

# For mapit
libgdal1-1.6.0 | libgdal1-1.5.0
python-gdal

# Search Index - Xapian http://xapian.org/
libxapian22


# Python - the language that the site is written in, and additional tools needed
# to build the virtualenv - may already be included with your python install
python-dev
python-pip
python-virtualenv


# Various miscellaneous tools - needed for the python libraries to be built.
bcrypt

# libjpeg - needed on non-debian. On debian installed as a requirement for others so no need to list seperately
