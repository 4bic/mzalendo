This is a heavily tweaked copy of the django.contrib.comments app.

A copy was made for the following reasons:

    * we want comments to have titles.

    * we don't want anonymous comments - so we would actively ignore several of
      the existing fields.

    * we _do_ want anonymous flagging of comments. Changing the CommentFlag
      model was hard, and replacing it with one from another app led to links in
      the admin breaking.

    * there were big chunks of admin missing (eg moderating comments)

    * some of the design was obviously supporting old installations (eg
      is_public and is_removed bools)

    * we may want to comment on things that are not in our database, so the
      contenttypes framework could not be used for that.

    * we wanted to autoapprove some comments. Using the bundled moderation
      system was overly complicated (action-at-a-distance).
